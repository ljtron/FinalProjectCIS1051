Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far the server is succesfully accepting request and sending html files to the users. We also now have the websocket connected to allow for constant stream of request and responses. We have a mongoDB database spun up on aws and we have the game running with dummy data.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have yet to connect the api to the server see we could fetch tweets. We also need to implement a signup and login page. Lastly we need to show the score of the game and past scores of games played by the user.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Latly I have been having problems with the game machanics and having it interact with the client and server side; but we believe we have found a solution to the problem.
There is also a problem with implementing the api.
