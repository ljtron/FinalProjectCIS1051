## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills we will need to acquire in order to accomplish our task include front end development for example css and html. I would also have to learn how to interact with the twitter api properly. Some topics I will need to research include oauth and different server side frameworks. For the work I plan on dealing with the backend while my partner works on the front end.
